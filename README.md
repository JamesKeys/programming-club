# programming-club

Here are the programming problems I did for the programming club at Villanova University.
We are given 5 problems to do every other week from the [Kattis Problem Archive](https://open.kattis.com).

- The `junior-year` folder contains the problems from the 2020-2021 schoolyear, my first year in the club.
- The `senior-year` folder contains the problems from the 2021-2022 schoolyear, my second year in the club, when I became President.

Kattis is a website that allows students to submit solutions to programming problems, and have them evaluated automatically by running a series of test cases on the submitted solutions.

Kattis has over 2,500 problems able to be solved in any language. They have memory and time constraints, and are given a difficulty which is adjusted as users fail to solve the problem or succeed.
