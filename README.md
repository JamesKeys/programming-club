# programming-club

Here are the programming problems I did for the programming club at Villanova University.
We are given 5 problems to do every other week from the [Kattis Problem Archive](https://open.kattis.com).

The `junior-year` folder contains the problems from the 2020-2021 schoolyear, my first year in the club.
The `senior-year` folder contains the problems from the 2021-2022 schoolyear, my second year in the club, when I became President.
